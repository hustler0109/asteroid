# Fifteen Sliding Puzzle

A 15 puzzle Asteroid game which you can very well reset to your own image puzzle as well.

- **Controls**: The game supports both GamePad and keyboard controls, providing flexibility for players to choose their preferred input method.

## How to Play

- **Keyboard**: Use arrow keys to move the puzzle pieces.
